# My GitHub Page (TBD)

This project is still in its infancy and I am trying to bring it to some kind of MVP. I think that it is nearly there, althought the following still needs to be completed before I can call it v1.0.0:
- Complete personal entries.
- Add commit hook to PREVENT PUSHING IF LINTING IS STUFFED.
- Page routing should determine selected sidebar item.
- Clicking on an item in the horizontal timeline view should lock the vertical one.
- Remove unused dependencies, such as testing stuff etc.
- Use arrow keys or mouse wheel to jump to next item in horizontal timeline.
- Add another timeline for live shows.
- Creme de la creme: Add a summary timeline that shows all timelines in one view. This will be AWESOME.
